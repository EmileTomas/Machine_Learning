# Introduction

### What does this repository do

This is repository to record the procedure of learning Machine Learning. I learned machine learning courses provided by Andrew Ng. in Coursera as initiation. At present stage, I choose to do some ML practice using  *Machine Learning in Action (Peter Harrington)* as textbook. What's different is that I use MATLAB to fulfill the algorithm in the book instead of Python.
